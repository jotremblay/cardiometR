\usage{
detect_vo2_plateau(breaths, threshold = 150, window_s = 30)
}
\arguments{
\item{breaths}{Breath data tibble}

\item{threshold}{Maximum VO2 increase to consider a plateau (default 150 mL/min)}

\item{window_s}{Averaging window in seconds (default 30)}
}
\value{
List with detected (logical) and delta (numeric)
}
\description{
