\title{Compute Overall Quality Assessment}
\usage{
assess_quality(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A CpetData or CpetAnalysis object}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to methods, including:
\describe{
\item{rpe}{Optional RPE value for maximal criteria assessment}
\item{lactate}{Optional lactate value for maximal criteria assessment}
}}
}
\value{
A QualityAssessment S7 object
}
\description{
Combine exercise criteria, protocol quality, and data quality into
a comprehensive quality assessment.
}
\details{
The overall grade is determined by:
\itemize{
\item \strong{A (90-100)}: Excellent quality, maximal test, reliable results
\item \strong{B (75-89)}: Good quality, likely maximal, results interpretable
\item \strong{C (60-74)}: Acceptable quality, some limitations noted
\item \strong{D (50-59)}: Poor quality, interpret with caution
\item \strong{F (<50)}: Unacceptable quality, results unreliable
}

The assessment combines:
\itemize{
\item Exercise criteria (40\% weight): Was maximal effort achieved?
\item Protocol quality (30\% weight): Was the protocol appropriate?
\item Data quality (30\% weight): Is the data reliable?
}
