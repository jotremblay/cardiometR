\usage{
EconomyMetrics(
  modality = "cycling",
  gross_efficiency = integer(0),
  running_economy = integer(0),
  reference_stage = integer(0),
  reference_speed = integer(0),
  reference_power = integer(0)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{modality}{Exercise modality: "cycling" or "treadmill"}

\item{gross_efficiency}{Cycling gross efficiency as percentage (typical range 18-25\%)}

\item{running_economy}{Running economy in mL O2/kg/km (typical range 150-250)}

\item{reference_stage}{Stage number at which economy was calculated}

\item{reference_speed}{Speed at which economy was calculated in km/h (treadmill)}

\item{reference_power}{Power at which efficiency was calculated in watts (cycling)}
}
\value{
An EconomyMetrics S7 object
}
\description{
Container for running economy and cycling efficiency calculations.
Stores the calculated metric along with the reference conditions (stage, speed, or power)
at which it was measured.
}
\examples{
# Cycling efficiency

# Running economy
economy <- EconomyMetrics(
