\title{Average CPET Data}
\usage{
average(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A CpetData object}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to methods}

\item{method}{Averaging method: "time" (time-based windows), "breath"
(fixed number of breaths), or "rolling" (rolling/moving average)}

\item{window}{Window size: seconds for "time" method, number of breaths
for "breath" method, seconds for "rolling" method}
}
\value{
A new CpetData object with averaged data and is_averaged = TRUE
}
\description{
Apply averaging to breath-by-breath CPET data.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# 30-second time-based averaging
averaged <- average(cpet_data, method = "time", window = 30)

# 10-breath averaging
averaged <- average(cpet_data, method = "breath", window = 10)

# 30-second rolling average
averaged <- average(cpet_data, method = "rolling", window = 30)
}
